;;; A thin layer on top of existing dynamic binding functionality, making

;;; TODO integrate with error handling? Don't I have some macrology for this somewhere?
;;; yes this is kind of useless since it doesn't put anything on the stack

;;; â†’ multitool, esp since it has no dependencies
;;; multitool.dev has debuggable, which is sort of same idea
